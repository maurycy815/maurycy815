## Hi everyone!

<!--
### Little bit about me
My name is Maurycy Zawistowski, currently (looking backward) i can say i'm IT hobbyst. I started from 3d graphic when i was 11 years old, why? This is fun, my father had Daewoo Matiz in that time, and i cannot find mod for GTA San Andreas which i played, so i decided to create my own. After some time i want to share my works in the internet so i started learn how to make websites, later i was interesting how the games are developed so i touched c++/dx programming.
